The guild tried to resolve the case internally by contacting Luigi Bettini and Amerigo Carnesecchi, respectively brother and close friend of Giovanbattista, but without success. The case was also brought to the Podestà and, at the date of writing, it was still pending. At the same time, Giovanbattista's family appealed to have the case dropped altogether. The third letter is a petition written by Nicolo and Fabrizio de' Medici, members of the Arte della Lana, concerning a mill that belonged to their deceased aunt Camilla that was being abandoned . The mill had been used as a guarantee for a loan in the past and still had pending debt attached to it. The two Medici brothers saw potential for economic gain derived from the mill and, for that reason, filed a petition with the grand-duke to have the lien against the property canceled or reduced.

In each instance an explication of the virtue itself is followed by a detailed consideration of the various kinds of sins that constitute a failure of that virtue. The treatise is accompanied by a table of contents (f. 196v-210v). Interposed between the closing rubric of the treatise and the beginning of the table of contents is a guide on how to properly make one's confession (f. 193r-196r); the guide to confession is not included in the table of contents and seems to be an afterthought to the work. The second work in the codex is apparently a German translation of the anti-Jewish epistle commonly known by either of two Latin titles, ""Epistola contra Judaeorum errores"" or ""Epistola Samuelis Maroccani,"" and assumed to be the work of Alfonsus Bonihominis, who claimed to have translated it into Latin from an Arabic original that he came upon in Morocco.

Work 3 concerns the life of a certain ruler (Sophi) of Persia who died at the age of 33 (f. 134v); it mentions his intention to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem (f. 132v) and his belief in Jesus's divinity, death and resurrection (f. 133r-133v).

Pen trials on flyleaves.,paper,"Collection of 4 devotional works with mystical and didactic tendencies. Work 1 is a version of the work on the six names of the Eucharist, or body of Christ (Buch von den sechs Namen des Fronleichnams; also known under the Latin title Liber de corde et sanguine domini) composed by the author known as the Monk of Heilsbronn, who was resident at the Cistercian abbey at Heilsbronn, in Bavaria, Germany, in the 14th century. Scholarship is inconclusive about the possible identification of the Monk of Heilsbronn with Konrad von Brundelsheim (Conradus de Brundelsheim), who was the abbot at Heilsbronn in 1303-1306 and 1317-1321. This manuscript, which contains contemporary corrections throughout, differs from the one published by J.F.L.T. Merzdorf in Der Mönch von Heilsbronn (pp. 1-68), showing a later spelling, and variations in the text, including the omission of the rhymed epilogue in which the writer identifies himself as a monk of Heilsbronn. The work begins with a rhymed prologue (f. 1r-3r) in which the author declares his intentions to cull and explicate wisdom from holy scripture, as well as the writings of Augustine, Ambrose, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Gregory I, on the subject of the body of Christ (unsers herren leichnamen; f. 1r); and justifies his choice to proceed in prose rather than in rhyme. In the main body of the text he explicates the six names: 1. Eucharist (eucharistia, gute genad; f. 3r, 3v), 2. gift (donum, gab; f. 7r), 3. food (cibus, speis; f. 26r), 4. communion (communio, gemainsam; f. 34r), 5. sacrifice (sacrificium, opfer; f. 44r), and 6. sacrament (sacramentum, heilikait; f. 61v). He develops the motif known as fons pietatis, i.e. Christ's wounds as a fountain of piety for the faithful (f. 42r, 63v). Work 2 is a prose tract on the question of how to love God (got mynnen; f. 97r); it begins by calling to mind John 21: 15-17, in which Jesus asks his disciple Peter whether he loves Jesus (Petre amas me ... Peter mynnestu mich; f. 97r). Work 3, also in prose, focuses on the Passion of Christ. In the first half, it mainly retells, with interspersed commentary, episodes from the New Testament, beginning with the story of Jesus washing his disciples' feet (John 13), through his arrest, presentation before Pilate, flogging and crucifixion; the fons pietatis motif is invoked (f. 180r-180v). The sources cited include Ambrose (f. 123v), Augustine (f. 126v), Gregory I (f. 125v), and Bernard of Clairvaux (f. 139r, 252r). The second half of the work is organized under didactic headings that refer to such topics as thanking God (f. 212v), obedience (f. 214r), prayer (f. 218v), and faith (f. 228v). Work 4 is a 12-line prose piece that names obedience, poverty, and chastity as the three virtues essential to a cleric (geistleichen menschen), and elevates obedience as the noblest one."

Two dates appear on the title page (f. 1r) of work 1: 1568, possibly indicating the date of composition, and 1593 (IV93), presumably the date of the present copy. Work 1 is an introduction to basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division), replete with sample equations. Work 2 is a collection of short discursive pieces on various topics mostly related to gardening (grafting of trees, cultivation of plants and fruits) and the medicinal uses of plants and herbs. The first two pieces, on rhubarb and barley (f. 21r-22r), are apparently paraphrases of material from a work by Johannes Mesue (i.e. Yūḥannā Ibn Māsawayh; cited on f. 21r); the chapter numbers 342 and 289 are included in the rubrics (f. 21r and 21v). One piece that does not concern plants is about the hinny (Maulesel); and another is a 10-line moralistic Christian poem (f. 22r). Work 3 is a collection of rhymed sayings and didactic epigrammatic verse, often of a religious, sometimes of a civic or patriotic nature (Vatterlandt, f. 31r-31v; Der löbliche Keiser Friderich, f. 34v). Work 4 is a chronicle of the peasant uprising in May and June 1525 in the area around Windsheim, including the beheadings carried out in Rothenburg by Kasimir, Margrave (Markgraf) of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (f. 50v). It appears to be a fragment of a longer work, missing both the beginning and the end. Work 5 is a prayer articulating core Christian beliefs and expressing gratitude to Jesus Christ. Work 6 is a poem in rhymed couplets, of which the beginning is missing; in the last line the poet names himself as Hanns Weber, writing in Nuremberg. It describes the flooding that took place (presumably in Nuremberg) from 24 February (Monat Hornung) to 2 March 1400; and goes on to exhort fellow Christians to be mindful of the coming of judgment day (der jüngste Tag; f. 53v). Work 7 is a timeline chronicling events relevant to the history of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, with the earliest entry being the martyrdom of St. Kilian in Würzburg (dated here 697; f. 55r) and the latest, the issuing of the new (Gregorian) calendar by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 (f. 59r). Events are listed out of chronological order. Work 8 is an account of the peasant uprising of 1525 as it affected Rothenburg, including a section headed 1526 (f. 72r) and an appended list of fugitives from Rothenburg (f. 74r-74v) followed by a narrative concerning fugitives under the heading 1527 (f. 74v). Work 9 is a 32-stanza song about the Franconian peasant war, which, according to the title is to be sung to the tune entitled Sie sein geschickt zum Sturm zu streitten; its form is typical of songs of the Meistersinger (Clark). The song tells of the assembly of peasants from Rothenburg and the events around the Unserfrauenburg, near Würzburg, mentioning the historical figures Götz von Berlichingen, Florian Geyer, and Count Georg von Wertheim (all on f. 76v), and using a first-person pronoun (stanza 15, f. 77r), as if the author were an eyewitness to the events; according to Clark the song's point of view is sympathetic to the peasants. Work 10 is a first-person attestation from Albrecht Renger, deacon (Diacon) of the church in Rothenburg, concerning the intention of Hanns Schwartz, of Detwang (Dettwang), to marry Margareta Larentz Wolffen. Work 11 is a list of the guests at the wedding of Hanns Schwartz and his bride (here referred to as Margareta Wölffin), written out by Niclaus Schmidt, innkeeper (Wirt) in Windsheim, with a statement about the services he rendered over the 3 days that it lasted. One of the guests is the bridegroom's father, also named Hanns Schwarz. There follow 4 business entries about payments and purchases, dated 1581 (written after 1582), 1583 and 1584, apparently also by Schmidt but unrelated to the wedding. The volume contains a listing of contents (f. 84v) of a later date (probably 19th century), and headings and notes in the same hand have been added at the beginnings of some works."

Breitinger zum Theill brichtet von Mund, zum Theill in Schriften, zum Theil auch in offnem Truckh (p. 65), followed by a list of lectures given by Breitinger, with the author reporting that the original texts are to be found at the rectory of the Grossmünster; 2. Herr Breittingers Sachen wellche er zum Theill lassen komen in Truckh, zum Theill aber nit (p. 80), followed by a list of published works; and 3. Sachen die nit in Truckh komen (p. 82), followed by a list of unpublished works. The rest of the manuscript (pp. 85-690) appears to be an account of Breitinger's life and times, consisting of the copied material from his works, interspersed with narrative. Sometimes his name appears in the opening rubric (pp. 235, 271), or his name or title (Diener der Kilchen und Schuel) in the closing (pp. 117, 225). Possibly some of the copied material is not by Breitinger; some references are to official protocols (e.g. the author notes that originals of two items are to found among records of the Dutch synod; p. 573). Following are examples of rubrics for copied material: Fürtrag betreffend den venedischen und frantzosischen Ambassadoren (p. 107); Delineattion der Reformation (p. 218); Wijderhollung dess ... vaterlandischen Projects (p. 235); Vom drijten Grad der Bluetsfründtschafft (p. 409); Gottes sonder bahre und duldige Hilff in meiner eignen Kranckheit (p. 567). One section headed Sweden (Schwed; p. 667) pertains to events of the Thirty Years' War around 1633. The manuscript ends with a prayer, including a petition for the fatherland (zu gueten dem geliebten Vaterland), followed by a Latin dictum referring to Breitinger (p. 690)."

The German-language narrative is interspersed with poems in Latin and German, some of which are poems on friends and acquaintances that begin with an anagram of the person's name. The narrative contains descriptive and historical passages about places, including a brief history of Pastorius's home city, Erfurt (f. 2-5), beginning with its founding and ending abruptly with reference to the arrival of Jesuits in 1589 (f. 6-7 have been torn out); a detailed description of Rome (f. 21r-28r); and shorter passages about other cities in Germany (Frankfurt, Mainz, f. 11r; Würzburg, f. 11v-12r), Italy (Ferrara, f. 14v; Venice, f. 32r-34r; Padua, f. 34r-v), France (Lyon, f. 41v; Paris, including a poem in Latin, f. 40v), and Switzerland (Geneva, f. 42r; Basel, f. 43r). The narrative ends with Pastorius's appointment in the service of Count Georg Friedrich of Limpurg in Sommerhausen in 1649, and his marriage to Magdalena Dietz; a genealogical chart (f. 49r), entitled Amici materni Francisci Danielis Pastorii, shows his wife's family, from her parents to their grandchildren, including his and her own son, Francis Daniel Pastorius. The remaining portion of the volume (f. 49v-238v) is a compendium of poetry and prose passages, in Latin and German. Many of the poems are about people, beginning with an anagram of the person's name and sometimes accompanied by biographical notes. One section (Familiae Pastoriorum descriptio; f. 111r-140r) is devoted to family members (family members are also mentioned elsewhere; f. 88v, recto of back flyleaf), including poems, prose passages, and mentions of births, deaths, and marriages. Other subjects are friends or acquaintances, and contemporary or historical personages, including Count Georg Friedrich and his family (f. 50v-53r); William Penn (f. 89r, 232r); Roman figures (Julius Caesar, f. 155r; Tiberius Nero, f. 155v); saints, Church Fathers, and other Christian figures (Joseph Arimathea, f. 157r; Mark the Evangelist, f. 159r; Origen, f. 165r; Augustine, f. 174v); Martin Luther (f. 198r); kings and emperors of Germany from Friedrich Barbarossa (f. 189r) to Leopold I (f. 214v); and rulers of Brandenburg (f. 223r-225r).

Some poems written for a specific occasion, such as a death, birth, or marriage, are dated (f. 63v, 93r, 125v).

The manuscript is predominantly in Latin, with significant portions in German, including poems, and discursive writing on topics such as philosophy and philosophers, history, geography, natural science, and travel. The early items (through the Dicteria proverbialia, ending f. 76r) are heavily influenced by Andreas Gärtner's Dicteria proverbialia, published in the second half of the 16th century, though Pastorius does not cite Gärtner. His Versus veteres proverbiales (f. 88r-99v) are drawn from Michael Neander's work of that title, also published in the 16th century, also unattributed in the manuscript. Some sections have what appear to be title pages with Pastorius's name (f. 100r, 196r, 226r), or his name is given in the text (anagrams, f. 101v, 133r). One text (Philosophia, f. 196r) appears to be a copy of a speech given by him in Windesheim in 1689.

Harkenroht had apparently published a book that was forbidden by the censor (f. 3v). At issue are questions about the proper jurisdiction of the Hofgericht vis-à-vis the chancellery of the imperial prince.

The rule governed the way of life of the monastic community (Bruderschaft, f. 7v) of priests, brothers and sisters who ran the hospital, and was evidently issued by the bishop at the request of a preexisting group (f. 1v). It is modeled on the rule of the Heilig-Geist-Orden (Order of the Holy Spirit) for the care of the sick founded by Guido von Montpellier around 1195, although it was independent of that order; and it is indirectly related to the rules of the Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God and of St. Augustine (Bauch). The statutes address such aspects as manner of accepting new members, including required vows (chastity, poverty and obedience, as well as service to the sick); hierarchy and responsibilities of members, with a male and a female leader of brothers and sisters, respectively (Maister, Maisterin; f. 8r); dress; manner of taking in and caring for the sick; handling of income and property; accommodation of guests; customs of eating and drinking; care of sick members; punishments for offenses; confession; guidelines for pious living (Wie man geislich sul werden, f. 10r; Ain gut Lere, f. 10v); and manner of accepting lay people as affiliated members (known as a Third Order; Dritter Orden, Tertiarenbruderschaft).

Documents are included from the following 8 rulers: Albrecht, Joachim I, Joachim II, Johann Georg, Joachim Friedrich, Johann Sigismund, Friedrich Wilhelm, and Friedrich III (known as Friedrich I, King of Prussia, after 1701). Main genres of documents include parliamentary agreements (Landtags Recesse); edicts, proclamations, or decrees from the ruler (Rescripti; Ausschreiben); resolutions issued by the supreme court (Cammergericht); and regulations (Policeij Ordnungen; Verordnungen). Included are attestations or opinions (Urtheile; Responsi) issued by the law faculties (juristische Fakultäten) of the universities of Rostock, Frankfurt an der Oder, Helmstedt, and Halle. The documents relate to diverse issues, including the restructuring of the supreme court; matters of general communal well-being (gemeinen Nutz; weights and measures, game, salaries of servants and laborers, public lands); the granting of privileges; coinage (Münze); usury; guilds; inheritance; marriage of Jews; contracts; public finance; duties; and church property.

The author begins by citing the case of Ferdinand (Fernando) Alonso de Toledo, who converted from Islam to Christianity during the reign of Alonso VI and was the ancestor of several noble families. Similarly, a Jewish conversion Ruy Capon is designated as the founding ancestor of several noble families in Portugal and in Castile. There is an addendum to the original work, tracing the ancestors and the descendants of Paul of Burgos.

The text was one of the most notorious treatises that attacked the traditional foundations of organized religion and of revelation. The treatise targets all three Abrahamic religions and accuses their founding prophets (Moses, Jesus, and Mohammad) of manipulating popular ignorance to obtain political power. The treatise exhibits a number of deist, pantheist, and atheist traits: it seeks to arrive at the understanding of God solely through reason and not through received tradition or sacred texts; the work argues that God is an infinite being that encompasses all existing corporeal and incorporeal substances; and it is critical of all alleged prophecies and supernatural phenomena, which, according to the text, are signs of ignorance of natural laws. This French version is based loosely on an earlier Latin manuscript De tribus impostoribus that circulated in the sixteenth century. The direct reference to René Descartes (f. 26r) and indirect allusions to the works of Thomas Hobbes, Gabriel Naudé, François La Mothe Le Vayer, and Baruch Spinoza point to the fact that this text did not come into existence until the end of the seventeenth century or the beginning of the eighteenth century. The authorship of the work is also widely disputed: some scholars have argued that it was composed by a disciple of Spinoza, others have claimed that it was a work of a radical Huguenot exile, still others suggest it was composed by a libertin erudit or by a disabused Catholic. This version of the text is divided into six chapters: I.De Dieu, II.Des raisons qui ont parlé les hommes à ses figures un Etre Supreme ou un Dieu, III.De ce que signifie le mot de religion, comment et pourquoi il s'en est glisse un si grand nombre dans le monde, IV.De verités evidentes, V.De l'ame, VI.Des esprits. This copy contains two inscriptions on f. 1v: the first references Jac. Frider. Reimannus [Jacob Friedrich Reimmann]; the second argues that this treatise was written by the secretary of Frederik II against Pope Gregory IX and references Voltaire's L'abregé de l'histoire universelle. A list of 73 references to authors who have discussed this treatise (f. 2r-3r) and a table of contents (f. 3v-4v) precede the text. Several responses to the treatise are included after the main text. The first piece following the treatise is a response to a critique composed by Bernard de la Monnoye. There is also a brief reaction by Maturin Veyssière de La Croze, royal librarian in Berlin, who claims to have seen a copy of this manuscript in 1706 in Frankfurt. Following La Croze's comments, there are several excerpts from various authors who have mentioned this work. The authors cited are Pietro Pomponazzi, Christian Kortholt, and J.F. Reimmann; two critical articles from the theological periodical Unschuldige Nachrichten from 1733 are also included."

Work 1, which consists of a preface (f. 2r-3v) and 43 numbered articles, outlines general principles as well as specific procedures related to the functioning of the government, while making reference throughout to the responsibilities of various offices, such as steward (Statthalter, f. 9v), chancellor (Canzler, f. 12r), secretaries (f. 12r), and chamber councillors (Cammerräthen, f. 28v).

Articles 9 and 10 (f. 48v, 52v) appear to address the interrelationship between the inner-Austrian government and the Hofkammer. Work 2 also makes direct reference to a new government instruction (unserer Regierungs Instruction ein neues; f. 45v). Both documents were prepared by the court secretary Christoph von Abele at the direction of Leopold (ad mandatum sacrae caesarae maiestatis proprium; f. 38v, 106r).

This novelty, according to the author, demonstrates the heretical nature of Protestant opinions. The critique relies on various patristic arguments about the proper distinction between true faith and heresy. The author takes particular issue with the doctrine of sola scriptura and insists that such an approach can lead to dangerous conclusions. The text goes on to list other characteristics of heresy and to refute Protestant critiques of the Catholic Church. The last chapters are devoted to refuting the Arian and the Berengerian heresies. Aside from Luther and Calvin, the text also mentions more contemporary Protestant theologians such as Jean Claude, Jean Daillé, and Pierre Jurieu.

The work further proposes more lenient standards for censoring that have been condemned by the clerical authority of the Catholic Church. The author(s) also claim that the Church has restricted more works than necessary by applying unfair and arbitrary standards and by judging the authors' reputations instead of the contents of their works. Of particular note are attempts to convince Maria Elizabeth to restore those works which argue in favor of extending the power of temporal authorities; twenty such prohibited works are listed (f. 43v-45r). The text uses the case of Jansenist theologian Zeger Bernard van Espen as a specific example and claims that although his works were approved by the Conseil General and by the royal censor in Austria and although the works received the royal privilege for publication, they were, nevertheless, wrongfully condemned by the Bishop of Mechlin.

In their own time the dukes of Saxony-Lauenburg carried the title Duke of Saxony (Herzog zu Sachsen).

The chronicle is prefaced by two documents: an undated edict, entitled Ordnung des Halssgerichts allhier zu Nürnberg (f. 2r-v), specifying procedures to be followed by the court, which acted in the name of the Holy Roman Empire; and a poem, entitled Loch Ordnung zu Nürnberg (f. 3r-v), which seems to evoke the experience of a person held in custody in the remand prison (Loch) and eventually executed. Under the subheading Urtheil (judgment), the edict lists methods of execution and gives formulations to be used in the court proceedings, as spoken by or to the judge (Pann Richter), jurors (Schöpffen), court clerk (Gerichtschreiber), and executioner (Nachrichter), as well as alternative formulations to be used when a forced confession (Urgicht) is obtained from a person who refuses to confess. Prefacing the poem is a statement that, until the time of writing , 1159 persons had been executed in Nuremberg, as found in an old book (Vor dieser Zeit Anfang sind in Nürnberg 1159 Persohnen gerichtet worden, welches man in einem alten Buch gefunden hat; f. 3r). The chronicle reports cases under headings by year, beginning in 1298 with a general reference to many Jews being burned not only in Nürnberg but also in Würzburg, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and other places, on account of careless dealings (von wegen allerleij leichtfertigen Händeln; f. 4r). After that it jumps to 1337 and the reports become more specific. Headings are given for 9 different years in the 14th century, for 18 in the 15th century, and for most of the years in the 16th and 17th centuries. From 1653 to 1709 there is a heading for every single year. Crimes include murder, robbery, witchcraft (Hexerij, Zauberij; f. 42r), forgery (falschen Brieff; f. 6v), and sexual crimes (sodomitische Unzucht, f. 26r; Hurereij, f. 49v). Sentences include executions (burning, beheading, hanging), floggings, and expulsions from the city. Individuals are usually identified by name; other details may include their profession, or status as noblemen (Edelmänner) or Jews; city of birth; and the names and/or professions of their parents, spouse, or employer. Many reports narrate the circumstances of the case in detail. Four reports include what appear to be transcriptions of official documents (Sentenz, 52v; Decretum in senatu, f. 57v, 58v), in the cases of Hanss Rüdter and Barthel Rauschbock in 1699 (f. 52v); of Helena Sussanna Wiedlin in 1708 (f. 57r-v); of Georg Spörl and Jacob König in 1708 (f. 57v-58v); and of Christina Sorgerin in 1709 (f. 58v). The name of Johann Michael Wiedmann (or Wiedtmann) appears on all 4 documents as executioner (executio facta per carnificem; f. 52v, 57v, 58v). Wiedmann is first mentioned under the year 1666, where it is noted that he had assumed the office of Nachrichter in September 1665 (f. 43v). Two other names appear on the 1699 document: Johann Sigmund Löffelholz, as Obrist-Wachtmeister; and Johann Cuno, as Auditor (f. 52v). A note under the year 1707 (f. 56v) indicates that the following 2 reports are on cases that actually do not belong in the Nuremberg chronicle: one concerns the famous case of General Johann Reinhold Patkul (f. 56v), who was executed in Kazimierz, Poland, for treason to Sweden; and the other, the case of Christoph Heinrich Stechau (f. 56v-57r), who was charged with the murder of a Nuremberg citizen, Georg Rössler, but under the jurisdiction of the office of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. The latter report includes a transcription of a notice about the execution posted in the marketplace of Fürth (f. 57r). Included also are transcriptions of 2 poetic works composed by people who were executed in 1691 and 1702, respectively: a prayer by Maria Magdalena Wölffin (f. 48r) and a song by Ambrosius Wolff Christoph Dörr, to be sung to the tune of Aus der Tieffe ruff ich (f. 54v)."

Although more regional parlements were established in the fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries, the Parisian body maintained the largest jurisdiction, presiding over northern and central France; it was known simply as the Parlement. These parlements were initially not legislative bodies, but functioned as courts of appeal for both civil and criminal and as tribunals in special cases involving the nobility. Records in this 3-volume codex begin at the end of the reign of Philip IV; the first legal question in the collection concerns the payment of tithes. Other notable types of cases include trials for illegal possession of arms, murder and other various violent crimes, theft, and contumacy. One particularly notable case is of a trial against Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, who was executed for high treason in 1602 (v.3, f.297v-307v). There are also a number of trials for heresy, blasphemy, and other religious controversies as well as several entries concerning the trials of condemned booksellers.

When the line of the counts of Geneva became extinct in 1394, the dukes of Savoy took over the territory and sought to gain political control over the city by promoting members of their family to the post of the Bishop of Geneva. During the Reformation, the bishops lost their political influence; the last Catholic bishop of the city and close ally of the Savoyards, Pierre de La Baume, fled Geneva in 1533. Having rid themselves of the Savoyard influence, the Genevans proclaimed themselves an independent state and in 1536 formally declared themselves a Protestant state to gain the support of Bern. The house of Savoy continued attempts to bring Geneva under their control through military campaigns until 1603, when they formally renounced all claims to the city by signing the treaty of St. Julien. The author begins with the city's earliest existence as a colony of the Romans. The text then discusses the sovereign rights that the city received from the Holy Roman Empire; under this loose confederacy, the bishops of Geneva held the title of prince of the Holy Roman Empire starting in 1154. The text then substantiates Geneva's historical ties to the Holy Roman Empire and the papacy and continuously seeks to establish its independence from the house of Savoy; it also enumerates various attempts by the house of Savoy to gain authority over Geneva, and provides documentary evidence to dispute the Savoyard claims. The author also discusses Geneva's complicated relationship with the Bernese, but does not address the Reformation in any specific detail. Although the author draws on evidence from wide-ranging periods in the city's history, the majority of the text focuses on the history of Geneva's internal politics and its relations with other Swiss cantons during the 16th century. The latest date mentioned in the manuscript is 1615, suggesting it was written in the early 17th century."

The pact members belonged to the Congregation Mariae Verkündigung (congregation of the Annunciation of Mary, f. 1r). The pact is referred to as both the Heiligen Messen Pact (pact for holy masses; f. 1r), and the Marianische Pact (pact of Mary, f. 2r). The book includes a narrative report about the founding and constitution of the pact (Bericht und Satzungen, f. 1r-4r), begun in 1764 and updated in 1768, 1769, 1774, 1775, 1778, and 1822. The report indicates that the pact was initiated in 1763 by 100 congregants who invested 100 gulden each. Approval was sought from the provincial Jesuit official Ignatius Rhombus and from Leopold Winckler, rector of the local Jesuit collegium (Collegij der Gesellschaft Jesu), as well as Bartholomaeo Payer, Patri praesidi (f. 1r). The pact was officially founded in April 1764. The book was regularly used for recording annual income and expenses from May 1763 until August 1784 (f. 11v-37r). The first set of entries (f. 11v-12r) covers a 2-year period, from May 1763 to August 1765. Thereafter the annual accounting begins and ends around 15 August (the Feast of the Assumption of Mary), and a review is noted in September or October. In 1765-1769 the review is indicated only with the formula: in visitatione. In 1770-1782 the accounts are signed by several individuals, with the titles prefect, assistant (sometimes 2), and secretary. Those signing include Joann Nep. Mungenast (f. 18v, 19v), Laurentio Neuner (f. 16v, 18v), Johann Bapt. Philad. Geisenhof (f. 20v, 22v), Joseph Anton Lachmann (f. 22v, 25v), Joseph Lanfer (f. 25v, 26v), Jos. Ant. Mayeff (f. 25v, 26v, 27v), Florian Antoni Griessenböck (f. 28v), Franz Xaver Heigl (f. 33r), and Jos. Seelos (f. 34v). In 1768 Laurentio Neuner was selected as the priest dedicated to saying the masses for the pact (f. 2v), and his name frequently appears thereafter in the records of expenses as pacti Mariani capellano. Income includes interest income and donations from individuals. Expenses usually relate to masses held on a regular basis, or for masses in honor of individuals, often deceased (crosses next to names, f. 19r). The financial entries for the period 1821 to 1825 (f. 37r) are entirely in Latin, and all in the same hand; they are in the form of a brief narrative, except for the 1825 entry, which simply gives a single figure each for income, expenses and remaining balance. A note in the same hand (f. 36v) indicates that the circumstances of the record keeping from 1784 to 1794 was unknown, but that from 1794 to 1807 the records were kept in the general account book of the congregation (Congregationsbuch), and in 1807, the prefect at the time, Alois Schwarzhofer, engaged Johan Kleubenschedl to do the record keeping for a fee. The addendum to the association constitution dated 1821 (f. 4r) appears also to be in the same hand, and is signed by the current prefect (Thomas Neumayr Mussia ; f. 4r); it conveys a decision that henceforth 2 masses will be said upon the death of a pact member."

Some rubrics touch on the city of Bremen (p. 225, 233, 263), as well as the cities of Lübeck (p. 98, 155) and Hamburg (p. 33); and on events in Denmark and Sweden (p. 25, 30, 50).

The manuscript appears to differ somewhat in details from contemporary sources about Pscherer (or Bscherer) as recounted in Gottfried Arnold's Unparteyische Kirchen- und Ketzer-Historie (parts 3/4, p. 219-221). The manuscript falls into 2 parts (of which the title page refers only to the first): 1. events in Altenstadt (f. 1r-9v); and 2. further events in Nuremberg (f. 9v-10v; rubric: Volget ferner, was mir zue Nurnberg begegnet, f. 9v). In part 1, which is divided into 15 numbered sections, Pscherer experiences visions involving one or two boys (Knäblein) who sometimes speak to him, in the mornings when he goes to carry out his duty of ringing the bells at the church for prayer. Part 1 ends with an entry dated 16 May 1628 (f. 9r-v), which reports a vision that occurred on 5 March, but which he was told not to reveal until the proper time had come. It is a prophecy that those who persist in the true Lutheran faith, despite persecution, will be rewarded; and that the persecution will end in the year 1631 with the persecutors being punished. The narrative alludes to the Counter-Reformation, with reference to clergy driven out (den vertribenen exulanten Geistlichen; f. 3r). Scherer also tells of being removed from his post by Jesuits (f. 7r), of Catholic schoolmasters arriving in town, and of soldiers trying to take him prisoner because of his talking about his visions (f. 8v). Part 2 describes further visions that Scherer experienced during the week from Sunday 14 September 1628 through the following Saturday, when he was living in the vicinity of Nuremberg. Those visions concern an army (Hehr Kriegesvolckh, f. 9v) identified with midnight (Mitternacht), and an opposing army identified with evening and midday (Abendt unnd Mittag), with the former eventually displacing the latter and coming to be headed by a figure wearing a golden crown (f. 10v). The last page appears to be signed Lorentz Pscherer (f. 10v), with an attribution below that possibly reads: Exulanss (i.e. exile). On the title page, below the title, is a quote from the Book of Tobit 12:7 (Der Konigen unnd Fürsten Rath unnd Heimblichkeit solle man verschweigen, aber Gottes Werckh soll mann höchlich preissen unnd offenbahren, f. 1r), followed by a rhymed 8-line poem that contrasts the bluster of the world to a judge in heaven who will soon awaken (Der Richter aller siechen / Er ist schon auff der Bahn, f. 1r). The manuscript is enclosed in a paper cover (possibly contemporary) bearing writing in a different hand: on the front, the name Pscherer, along with an abbreviated variation of the title as given on the manuscript, and the parenthetical remark: Original-Manuscript; on the inside back, the word Fastnachtspiele (Schrovetide plays)."

Document 1 is the letter by Emperor Leopold I that elevated Magdalena Sibylla to the status of Countess of Rochlitz (Gräfin zu Rochliz; p. 2), prepared and attested by Caspar Florenz Consbruch, and signed by vice chancellor Leopold Wilhelm von Königsegg und Rothenfels. Document 2, issued by the law faculty of the University of Leipzig, as jurors (Schöppen; p. 45), summarizes the trial, in which Ursula Margarethe von Neitschütz was accused of being a witch and using magic (beschuldiget, dass sie eine Hexe seij, auch sich der Zauberein beflissen; p. 17) to bring about the death of Johann Georg III, and to make his son fall in love with her daughter (p. 17). Footnotes in the same hand include citation of a work published in 1733 (p. 25). Documents 3 (a letter in French) and 4 (an impersonal account) are contemporary descriptions of the funeral of Magdalena Sibylla von Neitschütz, on 12 April 1694. Document 4 seems to end with citation of bible verses as funeral orations (Nahum 3: 3-7, Ecclesiastes 3:16; p. 52), and possibly Document 5, a poem, is part of the same piece. The latter, purporting to have been written for the deceased by her surviving brothers, ends with a derogatory epitaph (p. 55). Document 6 is a marriage contract (Eheverschreibung) by Johann Georg IV, acknowledging his intentions toward Magdalena Sibylla von Neitschütz. It includes annotations (p. 58-59) stating that it was thought to have been retroactively dated (retrodatiret; p. 58) to before his marriage (to another woman, in 1692), and reporting related testimony by Ursula Margarethe von Neitschütz, and by Jean Roussenet, a confidant of Johann Georg. Document 7 (partly in Latin), written in defense of Ursula Margarethe von Neitschütz, is signed by Dr. Mayer, as defensor, apparently assigned by the court (ad commissarios, dem churfürstlichen Amtmann nun auch dem Rathe zu Dresden; p. 105). Document 8 is an unattributed contemporary eyewitness account of the viewing of the corpse (Leichen Besichtigung) of Magdalena Sibylla von Neitschütz at the Sophienkirche in Dresden on 30 April 1694. Document 9 comprises a moralistic commentary on the Neitschütz trial (p. 109-116), followed by a collection of poems (some in Latin) about Magdalena Sibylla, her mother, or the Neitschütz family. The commentary, entitled All sins must be revealed by God (Alle Sünden müsset offenbaret werden durch Gott; p. 109), includes rubrics naming 3 privy councillors (Graf Callenberg, Ober-Hofjägermeister Erdmannsdorf, General-Major Friese; p. 110); the rubric Soli deo gloria, dated 26 May 1694 (p. 111); and a list of names of individuals implicated in the Neitschütz trial (p. 114-116). The poems include epitaphs; a composition resembling an oratorio (p. 130-136); and 2 anagrams (in Latin; p. 124).

The office, also known as Kellerei Waldeck (f. 104r), was until the Thirty Years' War located at the castle of Waldeck, in Vorderheubach (today in the town of Heiligkreuznach im Odenwald, in the Rhein-Neckar-Kreis district of Baden-Württemberg). The preface (f. 2r-v; rubric: Waldeck) by Albrecht Olinger indicates that Johann II, Count Palatine of Pfalz-Zweibrücken, ordered the work on 2 January 1612, and that Olinger produced it under the oversight (im Beijsein) of Theobald (or: Debolt) Pfeiffer (f. 2r), the Zent-Schultheiss (head of local law enforcement) in Heiligkreuzsteinach (Creutzsteinach; f. 2v).

The following emperors of the Holy Roman Empire are represented: Frederick III (f. 119v-124v, 216v-217r); Maximilian I (f. 84r-90v, 168r-170r); Charles V (f. 131r-v, 192r-199r, 213r-214r, 238r-242r); and Ferdinand I (f. 214r-215v). Other salient parties include: Sigmund, Duke (later Archduke) of Austria (f. 105r-v, 125r-128r, 165v-168r, 210r-213r, 217v); Hugo von Hohenlandberg, Bishop of Constance (f. 106r-108v); Jacques-Christophe Blarer de Wartensee, Bishop of Basel (f. 152r-157v); and Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan (f. 215v-216v). Among the documents of a different nature from the agreements are 2 concerning Heinrich Escher, mayor of Zurich (1678-1710), that appear to relate to Escher's diplomatic mission at the court of Louis XIV in 1687, as emissary of the cantons of Zurich and Bern, and the allied city of Geneva. One is a letter from him to an unidentified French minister (f. 242r-243v; dated 16-- ); the other is an undated prose narrative relating an anecdote about his refusing gifts at the French court (Wie sich Herr Burgermeister Äscher von Zürich, als man ihm zu Paris beschenken wollen, verhalten, f. 243r). Another prose piece (f. 221r-229r), also undated, is given under the rubric: Beschreibung von gemeiner Eijdgnossschafft, dero Herkommen, Gerechtigkeit und Befreijung vom Reich (rubric only in table of contents, f. 4v). It is comprised of sections on the original 13 cantons, followed by a polemical section that appears to be making an argument for the rightful independence of the Eidgenossenschaft from the Holy Roman Empire. In another instance, 2 letters addressed to King Charles VII of France are linked together under a single rubric (Wie die armen Jäckhen in das Land kommen seind, f. 216v), and are followed by summarizing remarks (f. 217v-218r) that refer to the Battle of St. Jacob an der Birs. The last document in the book concerns the Swiss peasant war of 1653 (Der rebellischen Bauren Pundtsbrieff; f. 244r-246v). The volume includes a table of contents (f. ii recto-v recto). Originally laid in at the back of the manuscript were 4 leaves bearing copies of the first 2 documents and a partial copy of the third (corresponding to f. 1r to mid 5r), possibly contemporary but in a different hand."

Also includes three other short medical texts: Ad amazare li vermi in lo corpo dele creature (on destroying parasitic worms in the intestines; f. 9v-11r); Pillole de agarico (f. 13r-v; with a second section titled Pillores aureis); and Inguenti (title from Zacour-Hirsch), a collection of unguents and medical recipes, beginning with Inguento baselicon and including remedies against syphilis and the plague (f. 14r-[17]v). These additions were evidently added by the copyist and were not part of the original treatise on urine."

The ledger includes very detailed accounts on the everyday transactions that result from the management and renovation of the farm: examples of such transactions include the purchase of feed for the animals; the expenses required to furnish the house or to replace broken pieces of furniture, or to purchase manure and other fertilizers. Other expenses concern the payment of various workers who help renovate the farm (carpenters, builders, and artisans who make roofing tiles are among those who appear more frequently). In certain cases, there are small sales and purchases between different counterparts, usually involving building or farming materials, and the names that appear more frequently are Francesco di Bastiano, Simone di Cipriano and Stefano di Bartolomeo del Ruta.

The biographies are followed by notes and reflections by numerous authors, including Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, Manuel de Faria e Sousa, François Eudes de Mézeray, and Gregorio Leti. The notes are followed by two short works: An account and refutation of the false rumor of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's conversion to Protestantism before his death; and the stories of three French queens ""killed by the Spanish"" while ruling as the wives of Spanish kings. The queens are Clotilda, consort of Amalaric, King of the Visigoths; Blanche de Bourbon, consort of Pedro I, King of Castile and Leon; and Elizabeth of France, consort of Philip II. Of particular interest is the prologue at the beginning of the manuscript in which the author discusses the debate over the origin of the biography of Philip II. The two possible authors discussed are Antonio Pérez, secretary to King Philip, and Pierre Matthieu, a French historian contemporary with Pérez. The author of the manuscript is in favor of Matthieu, and apparently is working from a translation of Matthieu's work in Italian. Henry Charles Lea also attributes the work to Matthieu, according to a note in his hand that appears in the manuscript (f. 7r)."

Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. Niccolo Amadori appears to be involved in such transactions both as a drawer and as a drawee. A fair, a usually quarterly event in northern Italy, was one of the largest markets for complex bills of exchange. In these fairs there was no physical delivery of the traded asset, but they attracted large volumes of investors nonetheless. In the event of a fair, like the one in Piacenza in 1608 mentioned in the title of the manuscript, businessmen and bankers such as Niccolo Amadori traded different currencies or commodities and these transactions usually happened via bills of exchange. Some merchants purchased considerable amounts of bills of exchange from various counterparts (such as Niccolo Amadori) to hedge the risk of the transactions, and made money betting on the difference of prices of the same asset which occurred on different markets because the same asset (in this case currencies and commodities such as gold and silver) does not trade at the same price in all markets."

Pérez, who at one time had enjoyed the King's confidence, had recommended that Escobedo be assigned to John of Austria in order to spy on him. When Escobedo turned out to be more loyal to John of Austria, who was the King's half-brother and Governor General of the Low Countries, Pérez leveraged his position as secretary for the affairs of the Low Countries by altering documents and correspondence in an effort to arouse suspicion against Escobedo, and indirectly, of John of Austria.

This account deals with the period after the King realized he had been manipulated by Pérez and had him arrested in 1579. It primarily illustrates the bureaucratic side of the more than ten-year-long process of bringing charges against Pérez. It includes multiple letters from Pérez to the King; his confession made under torture; a brief account of the sentence carried out against Baltasar Alamos de Barrientos in 1590, a Pérez loyalist who seems to have been arrested for this reason; and the death sentence against Pérez also in 1590, issued by the president of Castile, Rodrigo Vázquez de Arce.

When Philip V, the first Bourbon King of Spain, was crowned as successor to Charles II in 1701, he immediately sought to concentrate power in the royal person, emulating the absolute monarchy of his native France.

As it became clear that Philip V would be victorious, the negotiations with the papal nuncio in Paris were initiated to restore diplomatic relations between Spain and Rome. Dated 19 December 1713 when given to the Royal Council of Castile, Macanaz's summary also recommends the limitation of the Roman Curia's influence in Spain. Macanaz advises that in matters of faith the church doctrine should be ""blindly followed"" but in matters of government every sovereign must follow the municipal laws of the realm first and foremost. He argues that the Roman Curia has exceeded its authority in the administration of benefices and that these should be handled locally. He also recommends that the papal nuncio in Spain, who in 1537 had been granted legal jurisdiction by Charles I, be stripped of all legal jurisdiction and revert to the pre-1537 status of diplomatic representative only.

In the first part Pérez covers the conservation and enlargement of empires and it is here that he introduces the essence of his political philosophy. He argues that a sovereign must be loved and respected by his vassals and feared by his enemies. In the second part he outlines the significance of all the territories within the Spanish realm and also of the major foreign powers. He classifies them as either friendly, secretly hostile but outwardly friendly, or openly hostile. He also emphasizes that the territories of Castile are the head of the empire and instructs the young king on proper conduct towards the clergy, the nobility, and the vassals. The third part is a collection of 41 different comments on executive administration, referred to in the text as resolciones de Estado, and other princely conduct that Pérez has taken from the works of Cornelius Tacitus, Sallust, Pliny the Elder, Thucydides, Polybius, Plutarch, Herodian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, and Cassius Dio Cocceianus. Of particular interest is a comment by Sallust (f.274v) which recommends that a prince have many advisers who vote by secret ballot and a comment by Polybius (f.287r) which claims that a man in exile who is wanted for a crime against the crown and has no hope of restitution (which is precisely Pérez's status) can be trusted to defend the prince, who embodies his only hope for remedy.

Floridablanca sums up his many success as a politician and statesman and defends what his adversaries consider to be his errors. He tells the king that he is not interested in accusing or blaming any one else but rather in defending himself from those who would charge him as if he himself had been the ""author of the disgraces"" (f. 18v). He covers in some detail the conflict between Spain and Portugal over the territories of the River Plate region in South America and the resulting Treaty of San Ildefonso, which settled the dispute on Oct. 1, 1777; the blockade and siege of British-controlled Gibraltar by allied Spanish and French forces from 1779 to 1783, which ended with the embarrassing defeat of the Spanish and French naval forces and the signing of a peace treaty with Britain; the establishment of the Supreme Council of State in 1787, referred to in the text as the Junta de Estado; the creation of the first Spanish national bank in 1782; and his general opinions of the clergy and their proper place within Spanish society. The anti-revolutionary fever which gripped Spain in the wake of the French Revolution led to the reform-minded Floridablanca's fall from favor and eventual imprisonment in 1792. He was liberated in 1794 under the administration of the new chief minister Manuel de Godoy. Floridablanca's writing is followed by a short postscript (f. 114r-115v) written by Godoy in 1795 in San Ildefonso (Spain), asking the king to allow Floridablanca to live in the town of his choice and to receive his due pension."

The first is a royal decree of King Philip II of Spain from 1557 banning all subjects of the Spanish crown from the Roman Curia during the reign of Pope Paul IV. The king gives no specific reason for the ban but does explain in detail that the decree is to be copied, distributed, and read aloud in the public areas of all cities, towns, and villages, and that the punishment for violating the ban may include confiscation of goods and property, exile, or execution. The second text is a short description of the relationship between the King of France and the parliament of Paris, as it relates to the working of the French government. It is written by the Spanish ambassador in France, Iñigo de Cardenas y Zapata, in 1621, apparently for the benefit of the Spanish government. To illustrate the nature of the French monarchy he cites two historical examples. The first is the secret agreement between Francis I, King of France, and Pope Leo X, arranged at Bologna in 1515, for which the Pope required the approval of the Paris parliament. The parliament initially refused and the King was forced to pressure them into consenting to the agreement, which illustrates the author's point that the parliament cannot be entirely bypassed by the King. The second example serves as a counterpoint and consists of Charles IX's efforts to be declared king before coming of age, with the support of his mother, Catherine de Médicis, and the dukes of France. The parliament of Paris refused to comply with his wishes and so he went instead to the parliament of Rohan, which recognized him as king of legal age, and thus enabled him to successfully bypass the parliament of Paris."

Many other authors and scholars are mentioned in passing. The third letter, which is referred to in the manuscript as the second letter (f.131r), purports to relate the particularities of South America but the title also admits that it does so with ""frequent digressions into varied literature."" This letter contains information on society in the Río de la Plata region, especially as it relates to the European woman's position and character in relation to the slaves and Indians. There are also long discussions on race, skin color, and the terminology used to describe the various races. This letters also contains an interesting comment on vampire bats, which the masses apparently believed was a ""bird of the devil."" The author relates the role of the bat in certain Guarani customs and includes phrases in Guarani with translations in Spanish. There is also a particularly interesting discussion of the origin of the word aji, which is a hot pepper native to the region and ubiquitous in South American cuisine. The author then returns to a lengthy discussion of racial mixing based on his personal observations. Of the tangential themes discussed in these three letters, the most attention is given to the conflict between philosophy and religion. The third letter is followed by a postscript in which the author comments on his promise to the recipient to translate the Henriade of Voltaire. He explains that he will translate and include one canto at the end of every letter he writes. He then discusses some themes related to Virgil's Aeneid in particular and to poetry in general. Although his translation of Voltaire's work is not included in the manuscript, the postscript is followed by the author's notes on the first canto. This is followed by three ""additions"" to the letters. The first is a discussion of the birthplace of Saint Laurence of Rome. The second addition explains the method by which the Guarani derive generic names for animals. The third addition concerns the ""drunkenness of the Indians."" These three additions are followed by four more (much shorter) letters by different authors. The first letter is a report of an expedition from Buenos Aires to the province of Misiones to combat the Guarani Indians. It is written by Raphael de Córdoba and dated 1756. The second letter is also written by Raphael de Córdoba, but is dated from 1764. The author is now identified as a Jesuit and the rector to the Colegio de Cádiz. In this letter he comments on the practice of using ""espalmo,"" a type of tar, to treat the hulls of ships in Cádiz. The recipient of the letter is identified as the Marqués de Villaformada. The third letter, written by a certain Marqués de Casinas, in Madrid, 1765, is an outline of the author's plan for modernizing the sewage, streets, and transport in the city of Cádiz. The fourth letter is neither signed nor dated but is an argument against the Marqués de Casisnas' plan."

These statutes, initiated in earnest in 15th-century Spain, at first excluded individuals from holding public office or receiving ecclesiastical benefices if they were descendants of either Jewish or Muslim converts to Christianity or of individuals convicted of crimes by the Inquisition. However, by the end of the 16th century, Spanish society, government, and especially the Catholic Church were obsessed with proving ""cleanliness of blood,"" which was to say tracing ancestry back to the ""old Christians"" who had never been Muslims or Jews. Such proof of pure Christian lineage became the means by which previously poor Christians laid claim to the lowest rung of the Spanish nobility, the hidalguía. This had always been an especially divisive and polemic issue in Spain, but by the end of the 16th century its excessive dissemination and implementation had convinced many that reform was needed. Thus, despite an official ban by the Inquisition on any writings against the statutes, several authors, including Salucio, published works advocating change. Chapters 1-3 lay out the main arguments of those against the statutes and chapters 4-8 give pro-statute responses. The remainder of the treatise, chapters 9-25, illustrate the author's middle path, which advocates imposing a time limitation on the statutes. In these latter chapters there is some interesting discussion related to the status of the ""new Christians"" converted to Christianity from Judaism or Islam."

The conspiracy, instigated by the Salviati, Papal banking family in Florence and rivals of the Medici, and by the pope Sixtus IV (who had strong interests in Florence that were threatened by the Medici supremacy), with the help of Jacopo and Francesco de' Pazzi, also rivals of the Medici, is described in great detail. The biography of Cosimo I de' Medici also starts at his birth, in 1519, and contains a meticulous description of his childhood, his affectionate relationship with his mother, Maria Sforza, and the death of his father, Giovanni delle Bande Nere, in 1526. Alessandro de' Medici succeeded Giovanni, but was killed in 1537, and Cosimo became the ruler of Florence. In the same year the Strozzi and the Salviati, rivals of the Medici, assembled an army, which included numerous other Florentine exiles; marched against Florence; and were defeated. Although there are mentions of some of the most relevant moments of Cosimo's public life, including the recognition of the Florentine state by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in return for Florence's help to France, a large part of the manuscript deals with the private life of the grand-duke and his relationship with his two wives and various mistresses. Many passages possess a very casual tone and often purport to be in the first person (in certain cases free direct speech is also used). The biographical narration is interrupted before the death of Cosimo by the insertion of copies of letters by various Florentine noblemen, the most important being Piero Strozzi, Cosimo's enemy in the wars against Siena and an ally of the pope. Copies of other documents related to the same wars are also present, including an agreement between Philip II of Spain and Cosimo, in which the Spanish king ceded Siena to Florence. A brief description of the death of Cosimo and a copy of his will appear at the end of the manuscript. According to the will, Cosimo's only heirs are his children."

Volume 1 is composed of 9 chapters, followed by notes for chapters 1-8, which contain detailed references to the large number of sources used by Bertoli to complete his work. Each chapter contains, in its initial page, a short summary of its contents. The first chapter (f.10r-26r) contains a geographical and morphological description of the region where Argenta is located, a paludal area in northeast Italy, whose main cities are Bologna and Ferrara and whose main river is the Po. Chapter 2 (f.27r-40r) pertains to the history of the origin of Argenta which, according to various sources (including Tacitus and archaeological inscriptions found in local monuments), was founded before the creation the Roman Empire by a local tribe, the Spinesi. The third chapter (f.41r-51r) contains a possible explanation, highly supported by Bertoli, of the Greek origin of the political organization of Argenta, which was a direct result of the influence of a small group of Greek migrants who lived in the area and exported their ruling system. Chapter 4 (f.51r-64r) deals with the origin of the name of the city: according to the sources quoted by Bertoli, the name was very ancient and had probably given to the city by its founders, the Spinesi. The fifth chapter (f.64r-74r) enumerates the various populations that ruled over Argenta over the first centuries of its existence, the most important being the Spinesi, which shared the territory with the Etruscans, the Gauls and the Romans. Chapter 6 (f.74r-96r) contains information related to the christianization of Argenta and how the church of San Niccoló was built. Chapter 7 (f.96r-118r) deals with how the Huns contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire and how that affected the area of Ferrara, resulting in a disastrous famine. The eighth chapter (f.119r-144r) is related to the Gothic influence over the region, and the donations made by the emperor Justinian I to the city of Ravenna. Among the sources used by Bertoldi, the most important is the Eastern Roman historian Procopius, quoted numerous times by the author.

The first work is a detailed account of the conspiracy of the barons, which represented the last phase of the war of the southern-Italian aristocracy against the Spanish king Ferdinand I. Ferdinand aimed at modernizing the political structures of the kingdom of Naples and strengthening the power of the Spanish crown over the local barons; in order to do so, he focused on limiting the baronial privileges of the feudal families of Naples, Calabria and Basilicata. The first phase of the conflict between the barons and the king, between 1459 and 1462, was won by Ferdinand, but the conflict was not resolved and the baronial discontent was still very strong. In 1485, a group of noblemen from some of the most important baronial families of the kingdom of Naples, including the Prince of Salerno Antonello II Sanseverino and the Prince of Altamura Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, formed a tight revolutionary group with the intention of attacking the king of Spain. They had the support of the pope, Innocent VIII, who was also displeased with Ferdinand I over tribute due to the Papal States that the Spanish crown had commuted into a gift of much inferior value. However, in spite of the papal support, the conspiracy was discovered and repressed by Ferdinand, who had been informed by Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, a southern-Italian nobleman who felt threatened by the barons. The barons asked Innocent VIII and the Republic of Venice for help, but assistance proved to be insufficient and Naples had to surrender in 1486, after complex and laborious negotiations in which the Papal States, Venice, and Milan were also involved. Not only did the barons have to succumb to Spanish power, but they were also forced to cede important strategic possessions, including the city of L'Aquila, in the northern part of the kingdom of Naples. At the end of the work there is a short table with the most important names and episodes that appear in the book. The second part of the manuscript contains the most famous work of the Neapolitan lawyer and judge Francesco D'Andrea, Admonitio ad nepotes, a collection of philosophical and practical advice for lawyers, written in 1696. After analyzing the role of the lawyer in different parts of Italy, D'Andrea explains how the Neapolitans surpass their Italian colleagues in terms of skills, knowledge of the law and rhetoric and litigation technique. Their superior skills are also the best way to ingratiate the favor of supreme magistrates, and, in Admonitio, the author encourages his younger colleagues to exploit this to their advantage. After these initial suggestions, various examples of the lives and works of famous Neapolitan lawyers, including Giovan Angelo Barile, Duca di Caivano, the Marquis Torello and Antonio Caraccio, are presented and commented. The work is concluded with a short essay where D'Andrea explains how important the role of the lawyer is and how hard a lawyer should fight to maintain his position in society."

The work, according to the anonymous author, is based and draws on the research of a German historian called Johannes Reinhard (referred to as Giovanni Giacomo Reinhard in the text). In the manuscript, the various phases of the history of Genoa are analyzed, with a strong emphasis on the fact that, in spite of having been under many rulers over the centuries, the city (a republic at the time of writing), had always retained its individual custims, values and a large degree of independence, largely due to its strategic position in the Mediterranean. The city, of very ancient origin, was already flourishing before the rise of the Roman Empire, and maintained its power even after its fall. Occupied by the Ostrogoths in the 4th century, then by the Lombards, under King Rothari, in the 5th century, Genoa was annexed to the Frank empire in the 8th century and was granted a special status. Although its merchant fleet was not strong enough to place it among the most powerful merchant cities in Europe, the Ligurian town had still retained a level of independence. In the later centuries, Genoa was one of the first cities in Italy to have some citizenship rights granted by local nobles. In the 12th century, Genoa emerged as an independent city-state with a very well organized fleet and strong sense of independence as a city and, along with Venice, Pisa, and Amalfi, it was one of the four Maritime republics (referred to as repubbliche marinare in the manuscript). Various merchant families, the most important being the Adorno and the Campofregoso fought for power in this republic, especially in the 12th century, but this did not undermine the city's stability and in the same years, Genoa took part in the Crusades and expanded its political influence over a large part of Northern Italy. More stability for the city was also granted when it went under the protection of the king of France, Charles VI, which helped strengthen the city's defenses against attacks from other Italian states. Together with the history of the most important events that involved Genoa, the manuscript also contains information concerning the local governors, consuls, podestá and other public officials and their work. Some information regarding the laws of the city over the years are also present, but none of the passage in which they appear are very detailed. At the end of the main work, there is a short extract from a treatise on the history of the mint and coinage in various parts of Italy, written by Gianrinato Rubbi. According to Rubbi, coinage in Genoa started very early (before 1100), and a short analysis of Genoese coinage concludes the extract."

Although they were in charge of representing the citizens as a community, regardless of social status, they were in fact members of the local aristocracy with judicial, political and administrative power who managed the interests of the upper class. The letters written by the eletti to the king express their concern for the state of the economy in the city after the increased fiscal load imposed by the Spanish crown to the Neapolitan aristocracy, and beg for substantial reductions of taxation. There are a few denunciations of the discontent of the working class and its indigent status, but these are very rare."

The present manuscript contains tauntingly contemptuous portraits of the activities of some of the most prestigious families of Naples, only slightly concealed as biographical and genealogical essays. The author, who conducted extensive research from both archival material and oral sources, described the origin of the different families; occasionally, the origin of their name; how they rose to nobility and gained their titles; and their current activities. With a few fortunate exceptions, most families are portrayed as lazy, dishonest or undeserving of their privileges. Their customs are analyzed and criticized and a number of negative examples of their conduct are reported. In most cases, these facts are presented immediately after a brief summary of why the families are famous (for example because of their political position, or careers as lawyers, judges or officers), creating a satirical effect which exploits the contrast between the public image of the aristocrats and their private lives. Among the 75 families that appear in the manuscript, the most important are the Longo, the Cito, and the Grimaldi."

Most of the regulations concern the eligibility of paupers for benefits of the Opera pia, and of the young women for the Conservatorio. The two institutions mostly worked together, the Opera looking after the older members of formerly wealthy families who had been impoverished or become indigent for various reasons, and the Conservatorio caring for their daughters (which also made the selection process stricter for young women because, in order to receive benefits from the Conservatorio, one's family had to be either deceased or eligible for benefits from the Opera; should these criteria not be met by the young woman in need, there was no way for her to be to be admitted). The Opera and the Conservatorio also had very strict requirements for their members (the procuratori and the sisters who worked in the Conservatorio), also collected in the statutes, which regulated their election, and a strict code of conduct that covered almost every circumstance that could arise in the course of their work. Transcribed between the two statutes is a copy of a letter, dated 18 July 1511, written by Pope Julius II and addressed to the Opera, both to encourage its members to persist in their work, and, at the same time, to warn them against committing heresy and disobeying his orders, which would result in interdict and other punishments.

XXIV on spine.",Written in a cursive script by multiple hands.,paper,"Collection of 7 documents related to the Papal States. The first work is a laudatory essay, perhaps meant to be used for a public speech, that celebrated the election to the papacy of Benedetto Odescalchi, formerly dean of the College of Cardinals, under the name of Innocent XI. The essay emphasizes the qualities of Odescalchi and his suitability for the papacy, and outlines the importance of his election for the prosperity of the Church. The second document is a summary (referred to as minuta) of a bull issued by Innocent XI, in which he attempted to control nepotism among cardinals. The third document contains a short but detailed account of the revenues of the Holy See during the papacy of Sixtus V. A large part of the cash flow derived from taxation of dioceses, but profits generated by leasing real property were also present. The fourth document is an essay that describes the problem of the overcrowding of the streets of Rome caused by the excessive number of carriages allowed to circulate in the city center and the various attempts to solve it made by various popes, including Paul III, Paul V and Gregory XIII. The proposed course of action was to limit access and parking to any carriage that was not in the city in the service of the Holy See. The document that follows is a letter written by the marquis Massimiliano Palombara to the marquis Ottavio Del Bufalo. Del Bufalo had made an affront to Palombara's son and, in order to maintain the honor of his family and his own, Palombara sent Del Bufalo a formal challenge to a duel, specifying, in an emphatic tone, that he is a man of honor and that he would not tolerate further offense to his name and his family. The sixth document is composed of two parts, the first being a description of a heated argument between two noblewomen, Lucretia Carafa, duchess of Forlì, and the princess of Botero, and the second being a formal challenge to a duel sent by Ettore Capece Minutolo to Contestabil Colonna, both Italian noblemen. While describing the argument between the duchess of Forlì and the princess of Botero, which occurred because of an inappropriate comment of the latter to the former, the author depicts a very flattering portrait of Lucretia Carafa, emphasizing her ancient, noble origins and moral qualities. The princess, however, is presented in a derogatory fashion, as a woman of questionable morals, whose power only comes from recently acquired wealth, and who lacks the finesse that can only derive from an established upper-class family. A similar argument arose between Ettore Capece Minutolo and Contestabil Colonna, as Minutolo, a wealthy youth from a family of recently acquired nobility, insulted the older Colonna, a member of one of the oldest and most important Italian families. A duel was considered to be the only appropriate way to resolve the dispute. Between the paragraphs of the two documents, there are extracts of laws which regulate duels and similar matters. The last document of the manuscript is a copy of the edict, promulgated in 1707 by the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I, with which he relinquished the Kingdom of Naples to his brother Charles III, in order to support his candidacy to the Spanish Crown during the War of Spanish Succession."

A note on the introductory page states that in 1668, he was appointed to make a transcription of the original manuscript by officers of the Università dei Mercanti of Rome (an association of businessmen), as they only had a single copy of the statutes in their possession and it had become severely damaged by frequent use. The present manuscript is a later copy, with further additions dated 1743. Ripa and Ripetta had two river ports located on the banks of the Tiber River, a very important waterway which allowed the local merchants to establish business relationships with counterparts from both Italy and Europe. A large number of the articles contained in the statutes aim at regulating trades between Roman businessmen and their foreign counterparts. In particular, strict rules regulate customs, clearance of goods, prohibited goods, and the fees that visitors had to pay to the customs officers in order to be granted access to the city via river. The statutes also includes various chapters on the rights and responsibilities of Roman customs officers, whose duties included collecting revenue from imports; inspecting all goods entering the city; protecting both local and foreign merchants who traveled for business; preventing the smuggling of prohibited items; and enforcing immigration and international commerce law in case of violations. Although customs agents were not considered members of the military and were exempt from serving in the army, the statutes granted them permission to carry arms at all times. Customs officers were also granted immunity or reduced punishments in case of violations or mistakes made while serving in office. Moreover, customs agents had the authority to arrest suspects and have them appear before a camerlengo (a papal officer in charge of revenues with some judicial powers), who could issue a summary judgment for which no appeal was available. Another professional figure who had almost unlimited authority was that of the notary, who was in charge of validating customs agents' decisions and to supervise customs operations. A special set of articles of the statutes regulated wine trade, one of the most important products of the local economy. The regulations aimed at protecting Roman wine merchants and promoting their products, while discouraging wine imports from abroad by imposing high duties on foreign products."

The names of Belicozzo di Belicozzo Gondi and Simone di Giovanbattista Gondi frequently appear in the second part of the manuscript (f.24-33), and both of them disburse varying amounts to cover household expenses.

Many of the counterparts are members of some of the most ancient and powerful families in Florence, and the Uguccioni, themselves a historical, although not quite as wealthy, Florentine family (but originally from Pistoia, near Florence), appear to be doing extensive business with them. The Uguccioni were, according to the correspondence contained in the present manuscript, relatively strong in the textile trade, with counterparts in Florence and Bologna (an important national and international market). Some letters also contain notices or receipts of payment for textile goods sent or received. The present manuscript suggests that the Uguccioni also engaged in some minor banking activity, parallel with the textile trade, which was their primary source of revenue. The second part of the manuscript, written in 1520-1526, contains copies of correspondence and miscellaneous documents originally written by Francesco e Carlo Marucelli (probably brothers). The Marucelli were also heavily involved in the textile trade, and most of the documents reflect this aspect of their business activities. A small number of debts and credits with various counterparts, as well as accounts related to the sale or purchase of textile products are also present. A page of copies of notarial documents contains stitches and remains of wax and originally was probably stitched and sealed (f. 54r). The last part of the manuscript, entirely written in Spanish in 1532, is a short ledger of debtors, creditors and accounts of Benedetto di Giovanbattista Uguccioni for the year 1532. The transactions are related to payments in kind, or debts to be paid in kind (usually with horses or mules). Some accounts refer to times when Uguccioni was in Genoa, Rome or Florence for business.

Other counterparts include Filippo Salviati and Lorenzo Carducci. The ledger contains records of transactions related to money lending and to the sale or purchase of textile products, in equal measure. According to the present manuscript, Giovanbattista Detti, who was primarily a wool and textile merchant, loaned fairly large sums of money to his various counterparts, probably indicating an involvement in the banking field. He also sold wool to various Florentine merchants, predominantly to the Salviati.

Often includes the nature of a given transaction and its amount, as well as listing the names of the individuals that act as counterparts in the transaction. The first kind of transaction that appears in the ledger is related to the sale or purchase of textile products (usually silk). The number of these transactions is relatively small. A much larger group of accounts is related to debts and credits with the Spanish crown, which relied heavily on foreign funds (especially Florentine and Genoese) to support their military campaigns. The Medici were one of the families of bankers and financiers who made frequent and large short-term loans to the Spanish kings. Together with liquid funds, large amounts of silver (of varying degrees of pureness and refinement) were also exchanged, traded or loaned to the Spanish crown, probably using bills of exchange. A bill of exchange is a written order by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Some merchants, including Vincenzo de' Medici, purchased many bills of exchange from various counterparts to hedge the risk of the transactions, and made money betting on the difference of prices of the same asset (in this case currencies and commodities such as gold and silver) which occurred on different markets. In addition to that, some of the transactions recorded in the ledger that occurred between the Medici and the Spanish were brokered by Italian third parties (possibly Genoese) to receive the best price. Vincenzo de' Medici, in charge of the Florentine mint, had the advantage of being able to access a large volume of liquid funds and precious commodities, which resulted in the opportunity to create a diversified portfolio containing some of the most sought after financial products. Probably other financial instruments were also traded, perhaps some whose underlying assets (commodities, but currencies could also be used) were to be physically delivered at a slightly later date, as bills of exchange tend to work well for short-term transactions only; the complexity of the records in the ledger suggest transactions that are likely more complicated than simple bills of exchange."

Francesca and her mother-in-law, Ottavia Altoviti Medici, at the death of Vincenzo inherited his assets, including the farms of Valdinievole, Bravieri and Smicchi, all located near Florence. In 1558, Carlo and Alamanno, with the consent of Francesca, decided to become business partners and to manage the highly diversified family enterprise together. Alamanno was the partner originally in charge of the fiscal matters of the estate but, for a number of consecutive years, failed to fulfill his obligation, leaving behind a considerable number of debts with various counterparts. His mother, who had initially been the co-signer of some his loans and agreed to back his commitments, filed a claim to have her position revised, as well as to try to find a solution for the pending debts. An arbitrator was chosen and he ruled that the partnership between Alamanno and Carlo be dissolved, and Carlo (and his heirs) take over his brother's responsibilities. Alamanno was also to be excluded from further activity concerning the management of Valdinievole and fined. A similar situation occurred with the two other farms of the estate, Bravieri and Smicchi. Moreover, as a penalty for the delay in the payment of taxes, the farms themselves were very severely punished by a tripling of the outstanding balances. Francesca appealed this decision and the tax office approved her claim, offering a complete cancellation of the debts. The documents that relate to the aforementioned events are collected in no particular order, and include the proceedings of the trials during which Francesca requested arbitration to resolve the conflict between her two sons; a copy of the contract of partnership between Carlo and Alamanno de' Medici and one of its dissolution, as ruled by the arbitrator; and copies of the approvals issued by the tax officers."

A bill of exchange is a written order by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. Filippo and Piero Mannelli appear to be involved in such transactions both as drawers and as drawees. A fair, a usually quarterly event in northern Italy, was one of the largest markets for complex bills of exchange. In these fairs there was no physical delivery of the traded asset, but they attracted large volumes of investors nonetheless. In the event of a fair, like the one in Pisa in 1602 mentioned in the title of the manuscript, businessmen and bankers such as Filippo and Piero Mannelli traded different currencies or commodities and these transactions usually happened via bills of exchange. Some merchants purchased considerable numbers of bills of exchange from various counterparts (such as Filippo and Piero Mannelli) to hedge the risk of the transactions, and made money betting on the difference of prices of the same asset which occurred on different markets because the same asset (in this case currencies and commodities such as gold and silver) does not trade at the same price in all markets."

The essay, written in the first person and in a colloquial tone, sometimes using some of the linguistic devices that characterize private correspondence, also includes a defense of the position of Poland, described as a courageous country of soldiers that fought honorably under King John III Sobieski, without having to resort to the dishonest tactics employed by the French. The Polish are also portrayed as the only real allies of the Habsburg court, as the French intervention during the Siege of Vienna was slow and ineffective. The second document is a copy of the speech pronounced by the Polish ambassador at the Holy Roman court, Zieroveschi(?), in the presence of John III Sobieski in 1682. Zieroveschi expressed disdain for a rumor he heard at the court of Leopold I, spread by the ambassador Du Ternay Boucaut (referred to as Du Ternaji Bucò in the manuscript), that Poland was supporting the Turks.

A bill of exchange is a written order by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. Bartolomeo Corsini appears to be involved in such transactions both as a drawer and as a drawee. A fair, a usually quarterly event in northern Italy, was one of the largest markets for complex bills of exchange. In these fairs there was no physical delivery of the traded asset, but they attracted large volumes of investors nonetheless. In the event of a fair, like the one in Piacenza in 1599 mentioned in the title of the manuscript, businessmen and bankers such as Bartolomeo Corsini traded different currencies or commodities and these transactions usually happened via bills of exchange. Some merchants purchased considerable amounts of bills of exchange from various counterparts (such as Bartolomeo Corsini) to hedge the risk of the transactions, and made money betting on the difference of prices of the same asset which occurred on different markets because the same asset (in this case currencies and commodities such as gold and silver) does not trade at the same price in all markets.

For every podere, a brief description of its most relevant physical features is given, as well as estimate of its value, the value of the land attached to it, and what was grown on that land at the time the inventory was composed. In certain cases, information about the amount of cattle belonging to each podere is also present. Short notes and commentaries on how to improve the current situation and production of the properties are also quite common. At the end of the first section (f.11r), there is a list of locations close to L'Agliata and, for each location, an estimated distance (perhaps in Florentine miles) from them to the podere is given. The second section contains a very concise and likely partial inventory of the movable possessions that could be found in the estate.

The miscellany, referred to as filza, consists of 5 works, the first two written in Italian and the last three in Latin. The first document in Italian consists of trial proceedings pertaining to the murder of Margherita Mannelli, a Florentine noblewoman. The unknown author, who writes in the first person, appears to have a significant role in the trial, perhaps as a public prosecutor. According to him, the prime suspect was a man called Giovanni Martini. Moreover, Martini's name also appears in the second document in Italian, which consists of more proceedings for the Mannelli murder. In this document, the prosecutor explains that after many attempts to question Martini and another man in a kind and friendly way, he had to resort to torture to try to persuade them to confess their involvement in the crime. The circumstances of the murder are reconstructed and described in great detail and strong emphasis is placed on the premeditation and the suspects' intent to kill. The three Latin components of the miscellany are all legal documents. The first one consists of the proceedings of a trial between Alamanno de' Medici and Johannis Ser Pauli(?) for a dispute over real property matters. The subsequent document is an affidavit, referred to as confessio, made by Aloysium(?) for the payment of a substantial dowry to Luigi di Bivigliano de' Medici, who was to marry his daughter Alvisia. The last document also pertains to the marriage agreements between Alvisia's family and Luigi di Bivigliano de' Medici and contains further information on that matter.

Most of the counterparts were other textile merchants, dyers, tailors, or members of the guild.

During the outward journey, Ferdinando and his brother stopped multiple times to pay their respects to local aristocrats (such as the marquis Niccolini and Ricciardi; the knight Laccini; and the duke of Parma, who was spending time in Caprarola, outside Rome) or clergymen (such as the bishops of Cortona and Viterbo). For every stop, a detailed description of the activities in which the Medici brothers took part is provided, including which churches, museums or works of art they saw, where they ate; who joined them in each banquet, and how they spent their free time (usually reading, walking in gardens, or resting). Once Ferdinando and Giovan Carlo arrived in Rome, events are narrated in a similar fashion, but more space is given to the devotional activities the brothers participated in, sometimes with Pope Urban VIII, and sometimes with cardinals or other high officers of the Papal States. The banquet offered to Ferdinando by Urban VIII is also recounted in detail, with a special focus on the gestures and motions both of the grand-duke and the Holy Father. While in Rome, the two Medici brothers also spent some time with the Barberini and the Peretti, aristocrats and family friends and, together, visited some of the most famous historical attractions of the city (including the basilica of San Pietro, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Gardens, the Barberini Palace, and the Holy Trinity on Pincio Hill). Once they left Rome, Ferdinando and his brother headed back to Florence. The return trip also included multiple stops (the most important being Terni, Cesena and Bologna), this time along the Adriatic side of Italy, and at almost every stop the delegation consorted with local noblemen, both to reinforce alliances and socialize.

Other moderately substantial items include two unattributed works on geography(p. 1-39); anecdotal excerpts from the letters of James Howell (p. 71-91); the captions from the engravings in Isaac de Benserade's presentation of Ovid's Metamorphoses in verse (p. 193-223); excerpts from John Bulwer's Chirologia (p. 225-247); excerpts from Samuel Sorbière's Sorberiana (p. 277-287); a copy of George Savile's Character of a trimmer, noted in the table of contents as having been made from a manuscript in 1686, before the work's publication (p. 289-358); and a speech by Sir Edward Seymour (1633-1708) to Parliament in 1692 (p. 361-374). Named authors of smaller excerpts include the cardinal Arnaud d'Ossat, Michel de Montaigne, John Milton, Hugo Grotius, and Sir William Temple. The latest item in the manuscript, dated 1695, is an apologetic text about the refusal of Quakers to swear oaths. The last item listed in the table of contents is not present in the manuscript, suggesting that the end of the manuscript is missing. A clipping of a poem titled The limbo of lost reputations (by Thomas Moore, here unattributed), from the Times, 6 March 1828, is pasted inside the lower cover."

The letters are not always in chronological order, with frequent jumps between years. In his correspondence, the provveditore, whose name is probably Borella (f.1r), chronicles a wide range of issues that arise during the administration of the province. They include managing the Venetian troops stationed therein; maintaining relations with other Venetian officers in the area and in the motherland; attempting to improve the precarious economic and living conditions of the local population; and monitoring frequent bubonic plague outbreaks, containing the spread of the disease, and coordinating prevention strategies. Occasional interactions with members of Dalmatian and Venetian clergy also occur. For the duration of his office, the provveditore divided most of his time between the two large cities of Zadar (referred to as Zara) and Split (referred to as Spalato) and his letters offered detailed accounts of his experience of the Dalmatian urban life, often highlighting its hardships at every level of society. He repeatedly asked for financial support from Venice to cover the basic needs of the troops or of other governmental officers, who were paid meager stipends and whose already inadequate provisions incurred frequent delays before being delivered. Two small gatherings containing copies of dispatches dated 1726 written by an unidentified provveditore generale di Dalmazia to a member of the Venetian government referred to as Serenissimo Principe are laid in the manuscript. For the most part, they deal with the harsh living conditions of the Venetian soldiers in Dalmatia, as well as those of the local population. The election of clergymen, as well as their activities in various dioceses in the Zadar area are also discussed, and there are brief but clear hints of the tense relationships between them and the representatives of the Republic of Venice."

The delays caused by bad weather and the encounter with the French vessel would have prevented Mason and Dixon from reaching Bencoolen in time to observe the transit, causing them to remain at the Cape of Good Hope to observe the transit from there on 6 June 1761.

This biography describes in detail his conversion, his devotions, his preaching activities, his miracles, and, in particular, the political bent soon taken on by his preaching: it claims that Brandano's influence on the popular classes was a significant factor in the Sienese revolt against the Spanish garrison in 1552. There is a different life of Brandano in UPenn Ms. Codex 287 (f. 49-98). The second biography is of Cecco d'Ascoli, an astrologer executed for heresy by the Inquisition in Florence in 1328 (according to this text--other sources give 1327 as his death date).

Most documents appear to be official copies and they often contain wax seals and signatures of witnesses. The legal documents vary significantly in type and include the following: an official deposition of witnesses regarding a will, numerous deeds for various properties (mainly land and vineyards) being sold, rented, or acquired by the Bertins, contracts of exchange of real estate (both among the Bertins and with other families and individuals), receipts of rent, statements of default on debts, marriage contracts, and wills. Most of the marriage contracts are quite long, including details about the respective dowries and mergers of properties involved; 3 of the contracts are in vellum, 2 have paper copies, one is on paper with another paper copy; the vellum original for the marriage contract of Gouffier Bertin and Marguerite de Lubersac is in two pieces and is missing the middle portion (item 8a). While some of the wills appear to be quite formal, one appears on the back of a transaction record (item 20). Raymond Bertin has some of the most extensive records; his most notable documents relate to his dealings with Pierre Chastanet, who apparently defaulted on the rent he owed. The communes and towns most often mentioned in the transactions are Ayen, Brives, Chabrignac, Juillac, Limoges, and Rosiers de Juillac. All of the documents in Latin and many of the ones in French are written in a secretary hand. Of the documents that are originals, 19 are in Latin and 14 are in French. The vast majority of the documents in French appears in the 16th century. The items are mostly oversize and on parchment with a few smaller documents on paper; all the paper documents are copies (in one case an original) of marriage contracts. Many of the documents contain later French descriptions and dates on the verso side. Modern marks in lead also appear on some documents. Many of the items are accompanied by modern inscriptions, written in purple ink on 19th century printed sheets. All items are organized chronologically; 6 items are kept in an oversize folder."

The manuscript is a fragment, ending abruptly. Most of the documents were composed by various members of the Xahila family, especially Francisco Ernantez Arana Xahila and Francisco Diaz Gebuta Queha. The title page, in Spanish, was evidently provided by abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg sometime after his taking the manuscript into his possession in or around 1855. The early portion of the manuscript (p. 1-17) is a record of village and family incidents, including births, baptisms, and marriages, as well as accounts of disputes and the collection of contributions; the dates cited in those pages range from 1586 (p. 9) to 1619 (p. 15). The remainder of the manuscript (18-96) mainly chronicles the history of the Cakchikel Indians, from their legendary beginnings at Tulan until the early 17th century, with some aspects concerning relations with the Tzutuhil and Quiché Indians. A significant juncture in the chronicle, visually highlighted in the text, is marked by an internal revolt of a lineage group which took place at Iximché in the late 15th century (p. 48), and subsequent events are dated according to the length of time after this revolt. The arrival of the Spanish in 1524 is reported (p. 56). The writer of the final pages (p. 92-96) identifies himself as Don Pedro Elías Martin, whose account begins in 1584 (p. 92), when he became governor, and extends until 1596 (p. 96)."

The cover lists 12 items, but Item 7 is lacking. The items are filed in the order listed on the cover. Item 1, dated 29 June 1582, is a brief account of rents paid on various properties in the area. Names of tenants and properties rented are indicated on the right, while the sums paid are shown on the left. The recipient of these payments was almost certainly Jean de Lescut, seigneur de Pixerécourt. Writing in different ink appears at the bottom of the main entries. Item 2 is an official inventory of vineyards, fields and pastures belonging to the widow of Jean de Lescut. The extensive inventory was organized into several parts and was composed between 1588 and 1593. Item 3, dated 23 August 1587, is a short list of pastures whose tenants owe rent to the seigneurs de Malzéville. Item 4, dated 24 October 1593, is an official receipt of rental payments made to the seigneurs de Malzéville. The list is divided into entries that indicate the name of the tenant, the property rented and the total sum paid. Extensive marginal notes appear next to almost every entry; some calculations appear on the last leaf. The document is signed by Clement. Item 5, dated 20 May 1643, is another official inventory of fields and grazing lands in Pixerécourt. This extensive list (20 leaves sewn together) was made at the request of seigneur Bermant and of the widow of seigneur Fligny (presumably Anne Rutant). Entries in this document appear in paragraph form, not as lists. The document is divided into two parts; the first part is untitled and is signed at the end by Anne Rutant, Claude Calay, and 4 other people; the second part describes lands belonging specifically to Anne Rutant and contains the same signatures at the end. Item 6, dated 3 February 1648, is a historical survey of various lands in the region, tracing the acquisitions and transfers of various properties back to the middle of the 16th century. This item contains 33 leaves that are sewn together. There is usually only 1 entry per leaf; entries are followed by initials. The document is compiled and signed by Nicolas Day and Claude Calay. Item 7, a list of wineries from 1737, is only listed on the cover of the collection and is lacking. Item 8 contains receipts for rent collected from the tenants of the seigniory of Pixerécourt in 1739. The entries are divided into 5 unequal columns, ruled in lead: the first column indicates whether a payment was made; the second contains the name of the tenant and the property; the third contains the sum owed; the fourth and fifth columns are left blank in almost every instance and their purpose is unclear. Item 9 contains the list of rents owed to M. Alix, for the year 1740. Its organization is almost identical to that of item 8. Item 10 is a notebook containing a historical record of land acquisitions in Pixerécourt. These records are followed by a short history of the origin of Pixerécourt. Item 11 is very similar to item 10 in content. It contains a chronological account of the various property transactions, with particular attention to inheritance, in the area and enumerates particular contracts by date, starting in 1539 and ending in 1736. Item 12, of which there are 2 copies, is another historical account of the seigniory. This particular document, dated to approximately 1595 (Zacour-Hirsch), seeks to establish how and when Jean de Lescut came into the possession of Pixerécourt. One of the copies has extensive marginal notes that are missing in the other copy."

Both feature a centerpiece of 9 panels with mostly Biblical pictures on them, with a piece of text on each side of the outer frame, with strips of illuminated borders around the edges. While it is difficult to tell the date these collages were assembled, this kind of specimen collecting reached its peak during the 19th century. The text comprises excerpts from the New Testament gospels, a calendar of feast days, and homilies of Pope Gregory I. The identifiable texts include Homilia XXI from Pope Gregory I, John 1.29-30, John 14.23, Matthew 9.18, Mark 16.1-2, and possibly Matthew 8.1-2 (in the form found in the Dominica tertia section of the Book of Obits). One of the unidentified texts refers to the bishops Julianus and Severus. The scenes depicted in the center of the collages predominately show Jesus blessing and teaching his followers, but also show the annunciation, the second coming of Christ, possibly the calling of Peter and Andrew, a figure wearing a mitre praying to an angel, and possibly the moneylenders in the temple. The illuminated initials have foliate decoration. Much of the surrounding decoration consists of sections of illuminated borders with geometric and floral designs and one dragon, using blue, green, red, white, gold, silver, brownish pink, and dark brown inks. Some of the flora is recognizable, including bunches of grapes hanging from vines."

William had a twin sister Elizabeth and a brother Thomas (b. 1848). Between 1850 and 1860 the Gravell family moved to Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania. After the enactment of the Conscription Act prior to the first draft in July 1863, William Gravell left the United States and sailed to London, England where he lived for four years. In England he met his paternal uncles and aunts: Thomas Gravell (b. 1798), a gilder and framer; William Gravell (1796-1866), a watchmaker; and his two unmarried aunts, Mary and Sarah Gravell. During William Gravell's four- year stay he lived with his cousin Thomas Gravell (son of Uncle Thomas Gravell), cousin Thomas's wife Betsy, and their son Walter in New Cross, London, England. William acquired a job at Causton & Sons, Printers in the warehouse. In the summer of 1866 William's sister, Elizabeth Gravell, arrived in London and lived there for a year. William and Elizabeth Gravell returned to the United States in August 1867. Shortly after the death of his father in 1876, William married Adelaide Vogel. The couple had two children William H. Gravell and Arthur F. Gravell. Sister Elizabeth married George Berry and had two sons. William Gravell died in Philadelphia in 1929.  This leather-bound, ruled diary was kept from 14 July 1863 to 31 August 1867 by William Gravell during his four-year stay in London, England to escape the draft of the Civil War. Gravell traveled from Upper Darby Township, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to New York where after being swindled; he eventually boarded a cargo ship named Plymouth Rock bound for London. Gravell writes daily about his life on board the ship, including his sea sickness, storms, other passengers, amusements, rations, and his acquaintance with a sailor from Philadelphia. Shortly after celebrating his twenty-third birthday on 13 August, William arrives in London, England. He meets his Uncle Thomas, a gilder and framer, and then meets his Uncle William, a watchmaker. Uncle William provides William with ""the document which made me a soldier in the U.S. service for the space of three years."" William lives with his cousin Thomas, acquires a job at Causton & Sons Printers in a warehouse where he works from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. William's entries in the diary appear weekly, recording events, excursions, holidays, and family gatherings. William describes the yearly tours of the Crystal Palace at Easter time, Guy Fawkes's Day, Christmas, and Boxing Day. He records the passing of his birthdays. William describes going to lectures, museums, plays, pantomimes, recording the titles and theatres. William writes about attending service on Sundays at St. Paul's Cathedral, dinners with his extended family, and games they play, such as Whist. He writes of the walks he takes with his cousin Thomas or Mr. Jewell to Black Heath, Greenwich, and London Bridge Park. At times William becomes depressed and writes of his dislike of London weather and his search for friends. In the summer of 1866, after the death of his Uncle William, Elizabeth, William's sister arrives unexpectedly. William and his sister spend much time together during the year she is there. In May of 1867 William's parents send tickets for his and Elizabeth's passage from Liverpool to Philadelphia. The pair leave in July, arriving in Philadelphia on 31 August 1867, the last entry in the diary.

Although these documents were likely composed between the late 16th century and the 17th century, they cover events as early as 1302. Section 3 (Folders 3 and 27), referred to as Fogli di ricordi, alberi, fedi di battesimo e di morte e d'altri fogli vari, is mostly composed of genealogical documents, including large and detailed genealogical tables and birth, baptismal and burial certificates.

There is also one document concerning the will of Giovanbattista Tedaldi, for whom Giovanbattista Detti was executor. Giovanbattista Detti was not only a businessman, but also a magistrato, a high office in the Florentine administration, and a number of documents consist of correspondence from citizens asking for Giovanbattista's help with minor complaints such as postponing tax payments. Folders 3-6 contain documents, organized chronologically and covering the years 1583-1591 concerning Giammaria Detti, also a merchant and magistrato of the Florentine administration. Giammaria's documents are very similar to Giovanbattista's, with fewer accounts and more receipts for a variety of transactions, including sale and purchase of textile products and currency. Folder 7 contains documents related to the returns of transactions negotiated by Giammaria and Lucrezia Detti with the Monte di pietà of Florence. Folder 8 contains documents, mostly correspondence, addressed to the Signori magistrati Detti, Giammaria and Giovanbattista, concerning either requests for help or complaints about members of the guild of the lanaioli.

Folders 1-6 contain a variety of accounts that concern different businesses in which the Sangalletti were involved, both in Florence and in Rome. In most cases, the name of Francesco Sangalletti appears together with those of Andrea Arrigucci and Francesco Guidacci, who were likely his business partners. These businesses included the sale and trade of textile products, money lending and exchange, and sale of farm produce. A small number of accounts also refer to expenses for household management of an unspecified farm or mansion. Many documents present contemporary foliation and were likely part of larger ledgers.

The lists, 3 written between 1609 and 1611 and 4 undated (ca. 1600), contain detailed information about slaves captured by Italian galleys, including Florentine and other Tuscan ships whose captains were Jacopo Inghirami, Arrigo Arrighi, Giuliano Sirigatti, Girolamo Lenzoni, and Guglielmo Guadagni. These men were often members of the grand-ducal aristocracy or administration: the admirals Guglielmo Guadagni and Arrigo Arrighi were close friends of Cosimo II de' Medici and members of the prestigious military religious order of the Knights of Malta; and the admiral Jacopo Inghirami was a marquis from Volterra. The lists give the name of the captive, the place of origin, a physical description of the individual (hair color, build, age, weight, height, as well as any special remark, such as moles, scars, disability, and whether a female slave was pregnant at the time of capture), their destination and, sometimes, the name of the individual to whom they would be assigned. Most of the slaves mentioned in the documents were Muslims, captured in different areas of the Ottoman Empire (Greece and Turkey in particular, sometimes referred to as Levante) and North Africa, and deported to Italy (to Naples, Messina, Palermo, Florence, and Pisa) and, in certain cases, to Spain and Portugal. The first report, written by captain Giovanni del Corno in 1612, examines the conditions of a complicated trade involving the sale of slaves and bullion, in which the counterparts included the Monte di pietà and the Florentine mint. The second report, dated 1643 and unsigned, denounces the inhumane conditions under which a group of Christian slaves were forced to live and work in Tunis."

These connections are highlighted in many of the items of the collection, which consists of a large number of marriage certificates, dowries (sometimes containing inventories), death and baptism records, and genealogical tables. The Carretto were related to the Burgio, the Naselli, the Valguarnera, the Galletti, the Morso, and the Requesens, and through them acquired multiple titles and privileges. Moreover, correspondence between the Carretto and the Spanish king Charles V shows how the family stayed close to the crown even after moving to Sicily, and how they helped the monarch maintain a control over the Southern Italian territories. Wills of various members of the Carretto family, usually accompanied by inventories, are also present, and donations or payments to the local churches (especially Sant'Antonio da Padova in Palermo) are frequent."

The first letter, dated 1826, informs Diego Naselli that the court of law of Naples had granted him guardianship of Marianna. The second letter, written in 1827, contains detailed information concerning the sale of part of the estate of Marianna, which occurred on the Paris stock exchange trading floor and through private investors.

Over the centuries, the Requesens remained strong supporters of the Spanish crown, from whom they received numerous privileges and grants. About half of the items contained in the Requesens family papers pertain to these privileges, the most important being the concession of the island of Pantelleria, as well as territories in the areas of Syracuse, Marsala, and Palermo. The Requesens were also in charge of collecting taxes and customs fees in numerous locations of the Kingdom of Naples on behalf of the Spanish crown. Moreover, the Requesens were politically and military active during the Neapolitan Wars in support of the Spanish coalition. This long standing connection with the Spanish crown is emphasized in many documents, including personal and official correspondence, legal and notarial papers, petitions, and accounts. The Requesens also had connections, mostly through marriage, with other southern Italian aristocrats, such as the Naselli, the Morso, the Alliata, the Bonanni, the Fuentes, the Carretto, and the Branciforte. These relationships are chronicled in a small number of documents covering the genealogical history of the family over the centuries. Letters between family members and friends and relatives all over Italy (Sicily, Naples, Genoa, Venice, Milan, and Turin) and France and Spain are also present.

(who is probably Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, 1828-1887), leave from New York on 22 August 1874 on a Cunard steamer named Algeria. They arrive in Liverpool, England on 2 September and travel to London, where they tour the city and its outskirts. On 19 September they proceed to France, arriving in Paris on 22 September. Here they visit museums and tour the city, meeting friends and artists, including painter Albrecht Schenck (1828-1901). From Paris they journey to Italy, making several stops, even gambling in Monte Carlo. The writer relates details about France's landscape of eucalyptus and olive trees. They arrive in Italy, stopping in San Remo and Savona, where she records witnessing women working in the brickyards. A train takes the women through Italy, where the works of art and architecture they encounter in Florence, Rome, Pompeii, and Naples are documented. From Brindisi the pair takes a steamer to Egypt, arriving in Alexandria on 10 December. The writer describes the sounds of waterwheels, foggy mornings, the landscape (some of which is desolate and arid and some with barley and lentils), wildlife, bazaars, mud villages, irrigation, and local peoples and their dress. They arrive in Cairo on 12 December, where they visit the Cairo Museum, travel to the pyramids, see the sphinx, and are escorted by an officer to visit four mosques. On 20 December the women, Daibes (their dragoman--a guide and interpreter), and a crew of sixteen begin their voyage up the Nile River on a dahabeeyah (a shallow-bottomed boat with two or more sails) named ""Southern Cross."" A list of the crew and description of the boat including a layout drawing are recorded in the journal. The women often socialize with their friends the Browne's, who are traveling on a dahabeeyah called the ""Lotus."" Each stop along their voyage is documented; at Luxor, for example, they travel on land by donkey, reaching the temples of Thebes and seeing a Coptic monastery. The women encounter sandstorms and traverse the cataracts. Passing the Tropic of Cancer at the end of January 1875, they commence their return trip down the Nile to Cairo. The diary ends abruptly as the writer is describing Ramses III tomb on 27 February 1875. Six leaves are laid in the diary, including a list of people and distinguishing characteristics, a layout sketch of a boat, a plan to visit Syria, a landscape sketch in pencil, a clipping naming some people leaving New York on the Algeria, and a map of the Nile River Valley."
